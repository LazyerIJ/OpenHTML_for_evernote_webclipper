# OpenHTML_for_evernote_webclipper

Simple file copy bash file..

After writing markdown, It's little bit unnatural to move to evernote.
So I use evernote webclipper after export md file to html file.
It's good to keep form and style.

## UBUNTU

- Need to install apache server

>>openmd [your md filename] [your img dirname]

**and use webclipper!!**

## Mac

- need /Users/[user name]/Sites/tempmd directory
- need apache server and set default directory to /Users/[user name]/Sites/tempmd
- img directory should exist at mdfile path

>>openmd [your md filename]

**open http://localhost/tempmd and use webclipper!!**

>>closemd
